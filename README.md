## üìã Requirements

### Host System (Server)
- Python 3.6+
- Required packages: psutil, socket, threading

### Client Systems
- Python 3.6+
- **Hashcat** installed and available in PATH
- Required packages: psutil, socket, subprocess

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scorp/crackstorm.git
cd crackstorm
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install psutil
```

### 3. Install Hashcat (clients only)

#### Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hashcat
```

#### Windows:
1. Download from [hashcat.net](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)
2. Add to PATH

#### macOS:

```bash
brew install hashcat
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Start host (server)

```bash
python3 host.py
```

With specific port:

```bash
python3 host.py -p 8888
```

### Connect client

```bash
python3 client.py <HOST_IP>
```

With specific port:

```bash
python3 client.py <HOST_IP> -p 8888
```

### Hashcat test

```bash
python3 client.py --test-hashcat <HOST_IP>
```

## üìñ Commands (Interactive Mode)

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| status | Shows cluster status and connected clients |
| crack <hashfile> <wordlist> | Starts distributed Hashcat job |
| results | Shows all found passwords |
| help | Shows help menu |
| quit / exit | Exits CrackStorm |

## üî® Example Workflow

### 1. Start host

```bash
# Terminal 1 (Host machine)
python3 host.py
```

### 2. Connect clients

```bash
# Terminal 2 (Client 1)
python3 client.py 192.168.1.100

# Terminal 3 (Client 2)  
python3 client.py 192.168.1.100

# Terminal 4 (Client 3)
python3 client.py 192.168.1.100
```

### 3. Start job

```bash
CrackStorm> status
CrackStorm> crack hashes.txt rockyou.txt
CrackStorm> results
```

## üìÅ Example Files

### Hash file (hashes.txt)

```
5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6
```

### Test wordlist (test_passwords.txt)

```
password
123456
admin
hello
test
```

## üîê Supported Hash Modes

Currently CrackStorm supports:
- MD5 (Mode 0) - Default
- Additional modes can be easily configured

**Extension for other hash modes:**

```python
# Change in execute_hashcat_job():
cmd = [
    'hashcat',
    '-m', '1000',  # NTLM
    # or
    '-m', '1400',  # SHA256
    # etc.
    ...
]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Use only for authorized penetration tests!**

- Use CrackStorm only in controlled environments
- Ensure you have permission to crack passwords
- Use strong network security in production environments
- Network traffic monitoring recommended

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Client cannot connect

```bash
# Check firewall
sudo ufw allow 9999

# Test network
ping <host_ip>
telnet <host_ip> 9999
```

### Hashcat not found

```bash
# Check installation
which hashcat
hashcat --version

# Check PATH
echo $PATH
```

### Performance optimization

```bash
# Check GPU status
nvidia-smi  # NVIDIA
rocm-smi    # AMD

# Monitor CPU usage
htop
```

## üìä System Monitoring

CrackStorm automatically shows:
- Number of connected clients
- CPU/GPU information
- Active jobs
- Network status
- Found passwords

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Hashcat parameters

```python
# In client.py - execute_hashcat_job()
cmd = [
    'hashcat',
    '-m', '0',
    '-a', str(attack_mode),
    '--force',           # Ignore GPU warnings
    '--opencl-device-types', '1,2',  # CPU + GPU
    '--workload-profile', '3',       # High Performance
    hash_file,
    wordlist,
    '--skip', str(skip),
    '--limit', str(limit)
]
```

### Adjust network timeouts

```python
# In host.py
client_socket.settimeout(30)  # Increase for slower networks

# In client.py  
self.socket.settimeout(60)    # Heartbeat interval
```

## üìà Performance Tips

1. **GPU Optimization**: Ensure all clients have GPU support
2. **Network**: Use Gigabit Ethernet for best performance
3. **Wordlists**: Copy large wordlists to local SSDs
4. **RAM**: Minimum 8GB RAM per client recommended
5. **Cooling**: Monitor temperatures during longer jobs
